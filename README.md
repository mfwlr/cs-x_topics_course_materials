# cs-x_topics_curriculum
Landing page for a CS+X topics class' materials, as presented in "Designing and Piloting a High School CS+X Topics Course" by Isenegger et al. in SIGCSE 2024. When the ACM digital library link is added, this page will be updated. Likewise, should the project move to a different website in the future, this repository will remain maintained to provide a redirect.


For now, this GitHub just provides a link to a read-only copy of the current course curriculum. This document can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LYuC6sF5Wk8EJUR6z9x8Dpu6LiXzev6-0ImsgjF8MLg/edit?usp=sharing).
